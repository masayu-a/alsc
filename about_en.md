# About Advanced Language Science (E3P) Research Center

The center will promote empirical language research (including phonetics, cognitive science, corpora, and linguistic theory) using state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques such as Bayesian statistics and deep learning.

Specifically, we will advance the following six initiatives:

1. Establishment of a methodology for collecting high-precision audio and cognitive processing sensing data, utilizing experimental equipment that contributes to speech science and cognitive science.
2. Collection and analysis of language data spanning a wide range of ages, contributing to research on language development.
3. Promotion of empirical research on existing language theories.
4. Establishment of statistical analysis methods for large-scale language resources based on Bayesian statistics and deep learning, and development of language modeling techniques using machine learning.
5. Shared use of experimental equipment, high-performance computing servers for statistical analysis, and open data.
6. Organization of hands-on seminars to disseminate scientific analysis methods of language and to foster the next generation of language researchers.
